Each Workflow element has its list of Action and the list of Process that has instantiated the Workflow.

The name of the Workflow is unique inside the document, while the name of an Action is unique
inside each Workflow. Using keyref element, each Process Action refers to a Workflow element,
while inside the Workflow element there is a keyref that connect an Action name with an
ActionStatus name, and a keyref that connect an Action name to the value of a NextAction element
inside a SimpleAction.

An Action has a Simple element or a Process element, not both.
A Simple element can have multiple NextAction element, referring to multiple Action inside
a Workflow.
A ProcessAction element has a single attribute referring to a Workflow in the document.

A Process is named ProcessEl, always has a start time element and have 1 or more status element.

To avoid the convertion of xsd:dateTime to XMLGregorianCalendar, is used a binding that convert
xsd:dateTime to Calendar.
