# Distributed Programming II (A.Y. 2015/16)

Assignments of Distributed Programming II - Year 2015/2016

Each solution has been deployed using IntelliJ IDEA 15.0.2 but for the exam
must be used Eclipse Luna. Java 7 has been used.

The assignments give a score of 28/30 with exemption from final exam.
The score wasn't maximum because for assignment 4 was necessary to consider the
possibility to request a list of Workflow and not always all of them.
