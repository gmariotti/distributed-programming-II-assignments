The Information element is represented by two elements, a Workflows element, that contains
0 or more Workflow elements, and a Processes element, that contains 0 or more Process element.

Each Workflow element has a name, that must be an ID inside the document, and one or more
Action elements that define him.
Each Action element can be a SimpleAction or a ProcessAction, so can have only one element between 
SimpleAc and ProcessAc.
SimpleAc contains, as attribute, the list of Actions, while ProcessAc has, as attribute, the
next Workflow name as a IDREF.

Each Process element must have a StartTime element and one or more Status element, while the
attribute Workflow is an IDREF of a Workflow in the document.
Each Status element can have an EndTime element, must have an Action name to which it refers
and can have an Actor name.

Both StartTime and EndTime element are managed by code.
